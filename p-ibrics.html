      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p class="lead">
        IBRICS focuses on developing robotic systems that can observe human motion,
        understand it using computer vision and machine learning, and then reproduce
        similar behaviours on real robots. The project combines pose estimation,
        3D motion analysis, trajectory tracking and advanced control to enable robots
        to perform dynamic, human-like actions in realistic environments.
      </p>
      <p>
        By integrating deep learning, reinforcement learning and optimization-based
        control, IBRICS aims to build intelligent robotic agents capable of robust
        interaction with humans and other robots, with applications ranging from
        industrial settings to collaborative and assistive tasks.

            AHMP: Agile Humanoid Motion Planning With Contact Sequence Discovery. Tsikelis, I., Tsiatsianas, E., Kiourt, C., Ivaldi, S., Chatzilygeroudis, K., Hoffman, E.M.  IEEE-RAS 24th International Conference on Humanoid Robots (Humanoids)
          </h5>
          <a class="card-subtitle text-muted mb-2"> Abstract: Planning agile whole-body motions for legged and humanoid robots is a fundamental requirement 
            for enabling dynamic tasks such as running, jumping, and fast reactive maneuvers. In this work, we present AHMP, a multi-contact motion 
            planning framework based on bi-level optimization that integrates a contact sequence discovery technique, using the Mixed-Distribution 
            Cross-Entropy Method (CEM-MD), and an efficient trajectory optimization scheme, which parameterizes the robot’s poses and motions in
             the tangent space of SE(3). AHMP permits the automatic generation of feasible contact configurations, with associated whole-body dynamic
              transitions. We validate our approach on a set of challenging agile motion planning tasks for humanoid robots, demonstrating that contact
               sequence discovery combined with tangent space parameterization leads to highly dynamic motion plans while remaining computationally efficient.</a>
