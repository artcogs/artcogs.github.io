      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p class="lead">
        The research project focuses on developing a system that combines Computer Vision, Machine Learning, 
        and Optimization-based Control for analyzing and recognizing human behaviors in realistic environments, 
        and transferring these behaviors to robotic systems. The aim is to create a system that enables robotic 
        systems to imitate dynamic movements and behaviors through the processing of visual data and machine learning algorithms.
        The project contributes to the development of intelligent robotic agents that can interact effectively both with each 
        other and with humans in real-world situations.

        The project advances innovative technologies in four main directions: extraction of human body pose from images,
         analysis of 3D human motion, tracking of dynamic trajectories in 3D, and development of controllers for robot manipulation. 
         The project leverages deep learning, reinforcement learning, and optimization-based control techniques, with the goal of developing robotic 
         systems for industrial and other applications, such as human-robot collaboration.

            AHMP: Agile Humanoid Motion Planning With Contact Sequence Discovery. Tsikelis, I., Tsiatsianas, E., Kiourt, C., Ivaldi, S., Chatzilygeroudis, K., Hoffman, E.M.  IEEE-RAS 24th International Conference on Humanoid Robots (Humanoids)
          </h5>
          <p class="card-subtitle text-muted mb-2"> Abstract: Planning agile whole-body motions for legged and humanoid robots is a fundamental requirement 
            for enabling dynamic tasks such as running, jumping, and fast reactive maneuvers. In this work, we present AHMP, a multi-contact motion 
            planning framework based on bi-level optimization that integrates a contact sequence discovery technique, using the Mixed-Distribution 
            Cross-Entropy Method (CEM-MD), and an efficient trajectory optimization scheme, which parameterizes the robot’s poses and motions in
             the tangent space of SE(3). AHMP permits the automatic generation of feasible contact configurations, with associated whole-body dynamic
              transitions. We validate our approach on a set of challenging agile motion planning tasks for humanoid robots, demonstrating that contact
               sequence discovery combined with tangent space parameterization leads to highly dynamic motion plans while remaining computationally efficient.
