      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p class="lead">
        UNICHE aspires to co-design and deliver an intuitive, technology-agnostic “no-code” platform
        that enables cultural heritage stakeholders to effortlessly create and share high-quality
        interactive experiences. The platform acts as a single-entry, collaborative tool that lowers
        technical barriers and supports multimodal content production.
      </p>
      <p>
        With its user-friendly environment, the platform empowers cultural heritage institutions and
        professionals, researchers, creative-industry freelancers, and resource-limited organisations
        to collaboratively generate rich interactive content in multiple formats. UNICHE prioritises
        ease of use and accessibility, minimising the need for specialised expertise while maximising
        the impact and reach of cultural heritage experiences for diverse audiences.
      </p>
      <p>
        By leveraging advanced technologies already developed by the consortium, UNICHE provides an
        integrated platform comprising a Repository, Authoring Environment, Experience Applications,
        and an Evaluation Tool. Together, these components holistically address the “four E’s” of
        cultural heritage: <strong>Exhibits</strong>, <strong>Experience design</strong>,
        <strong>Exhibitions</strong>, and <strong>Evaluation</strong>.

      <h3>Pilot Sites &amp; Open Call</h3>
      <p>
        UNICHE will be validated through pilot scenarios that cover diverse cultural heritage
        settings:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Open-air archaeological sites</li>
        <li>Museum permanent exhibitions</li>
        <li>Portable / travelling exhibitions</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In a second phase, the platform will be further tested through an open call addressed to
        small cultural heritage institutions and creative-industry professionals. This process will
        foster a broader community of practice around UNICHE, support co-creation, and ensure that
        the platform responds to real-world needs across different cultural contexts.
