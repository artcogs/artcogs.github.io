      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p class="lead">
        UNICHE aspires to co-design and deliver an intuitive, technology-agnostic “no-code” platform
        that enables cultural heritage stakeholders to effortlessly create and share high-quality
        interactive experiences. The platform acts as a single-entry, collaborative tool that lowers
        technical barriers and supports multimodal content production.
      </p>
      <p>
        With its user-friendly environment, the platform empowers cultural heritage institutions and
        professionals, researchers, creative-industry freelancers, and resource-limited organisations
        to collaboratively generate rich interactive content in multiple formats. UNICHE prioritises
        ease of use and accessibility, minimising the need for specialised expertise while maximising
        the impact and reach of cultural heritage experiences for diverse audiences.
      </p>
      <p>
        By leveraging advanced technologies already developed by the consortium, UNICHE provides an
        integrated platform comprising a Repository, Authoring Environment, Experience Applications,
        and an Evaluation Tool. Together, these components holistically address the “four E’s” of
        cultural heritage: <strong>Exhibits</strong>, <strong>Experience design</strong>,
        <strong>Exhibitions</strong>, and <strong>Evaluation</strong>.

      <h3>Pilot Sites &amp; Open Call</h3>
      <p>
        UNICHE will be validated through pilot scenarios that cover diverse cultural heritage
        settings:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Open-air archaeological sites</li>
        <li>Museum permanent exhibitions</li>
        <li>Portable / travelling exhibitions</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In a second phase, the platform will be further tested through an open call addressed to
        small cultural heritage institutions and creative-industry professionals. This process will
        foster a broader community of practice around UNICHE, support co-creation, and ensure that
        the platform responds to real-world needs across different cultural contexts.

                This task focuses on collecting and modelling visitor behaviour data through surveys,
                interaction logs, and relevant open datasets. The data are analysed to understand
                user preferences and experience patterns, enabling user-centric design and
                optimisation of interactions with UNICHE’s applications. Cleaned and structured

                for creating virtual and XR exhibition spaces. These tools provide intuitive,
                space-aware interfaces for defining exhibition layouts, interaction hotspots, and
                content presentation points in VR, AR, and virtual tours. They integrate content
                from cultural heritage repositories and support MR headsets, enabling curators,
                archaeologists, and CH professionals to co-create impactful exhibitions in real time.

                applications. Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented

                assistance, answers user questions, and offers recommendations linked to cultural
                heritage content. By dynamically accessing external data sources, the agent delivers
                contextually accurate and up-to-date interactions, supporting interactive
                storytelling, exploration, and education. The component is closely integrated with
                the storytelling modules in WP7.

                T6.5 focuses on AI-powered algorithms to analyse visitor behaviour across the
                applications developed in WP6. By combining interaction data with user profiles and
                preferences from T4.5, the task builds a comprehensive user-profiling model that
                supports personalised content delivery and adaptive features. Real-time analytics,
                dashboards, and KPIs are implemented as part of the UNICHE Visitor Experience
                Evaluation Tool, enabling continuous monitoring and optimisation of the overall
                platform and exhibition design.
