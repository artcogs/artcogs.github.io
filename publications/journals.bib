abstract = {The last decades, crowd simulation for crisis management is highlighted as an important topic of interest for many scientific fields. As the continuous evolution of computational resources increases, along with the capabilities of Artificial Intelligence, the demand for better and more realistic simulation has become more attractive and popular to scientists. Along those years, there have been published hundreds of research articles and numerous different systems have been created that aim to simulate crowd behaviors, crisis cases and emergency evacuation scenarios. For better outcomes, recent research has focused on the separation of the problem of crisis management, to multiple research sub-fields (categories), such as the navigation of the simulated pedestrians, their psychology, group dynamics etc. There have been extended research works suggesting new methods and techniques for those categories of problems. In this paper, we propose three main research categories, each one consisting of several sub-categories, relying on crowd simulation for crisis management aspects and we present the outcomes of the last decade, focusing mostly on works exploiting multi-agent technologies. We analyze a number of technologies, methodologies, techniques, tools and systems introduced throughout the last years. A comparative review and discussion of the proposed categories is presented toward the identification of the most efficient aspects of the proposed categories. A general framework toward the future crowd simulation for crisis management is presented to yield the most realistic outcomes. The paper is concluded with some highlights and open questions for future directions.}

abstract = {The evolving technologies of the game engines and the Web have reached a level of maturity that enables them to contribute significantly to the long-celebrated blending of culture and education with gaming. In this work, we present DynaMus, an innovative fully dynamic Web-based virtual museum framework that relies entirely on users’ creativity and on the exploitation of the rich content in distributed Web resources. DynaMus is able to connect to popular repositories, such as Europeana and Google, and retrieve content that can be used in creating virtual exhibitions. It exploits modern Web technologies such as open linked data in an attempt to move towards the semantic Web by exploiting the abundance in data availability. DynaMus provides a complete authoring interface, in which anyone can easily create customised virtual exhibitions, while guaranteeing an engaging experience by relying on modern game engine technologies. The concept easily connects to educational settings as has been illustrated by case studies, one of which is presented in this paper.}
