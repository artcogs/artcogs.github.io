    abstract = {The last decades, crowd simulation for crisis management is highlighted as an important topic of interest for many scientific fields. As the continuous evolution of computational resources increases, along with the capabilities of Artificial Intelligence, the demand for better and more realistic simulation has become more attractive and popular to scientists. Along those years, there have been published hundreds of research articles and numerous different systems have been created that aim to simulate crowd behaviors, crisis cases and emergency evacuation scenarios. For better outcomes, recent research has focused on the separation of the problem of crisis management, to multiple research sub-fields (categories), such as the navigation of the simulated pedestrians, their psychology, group dynamics etc. There have been extended research works suggesting new methods and techniques for those categories of problems. In this paper, we propose three main research categories, each one consisting of several sub-categories, relying on crowd simulation for crisis management aspects and we present the outcomes of the last decade, focusing mostly on works exploiting multi-agent technologies. We analyze a number of technologies, methodologies, techniques, tools and systems introduced throughout the last years. A comparative review and discussion of the proposed categories is presented toward the identification of the most efficient aspects of the proposed categories. A general framework toward the future crowd simulation for crisis management is presented to yield the most realistic outcomes. The paper is concluded with some highlights and open questions for future directions.}

    ABSTRACT = {This paper introduces the concept of evolving actor–network ontologies (EANO) as a new paradigm for cultural digital twins. Building on actor–network theory, EANO reframes ontologies from static representations into reflexive, dynamic structures in which semantic interpretations are continuously negotiated among heterogeneous actors. We propose a five-layer architecture that operationalizes this principle, embedding reflexivity, actor salience, and systemic parameters such as resistance and volatility directly into the ontological model. To illustrate this approach, we present minimal simulations that demonstrate how different actor constellations and systemic conditions lead to distinct patterns of semantic evolution, ranging from expert erosion to contested equilibria and balanced coexistence. Rather than serving as predictive models, these simulations exemplify how EANO captures semantic plurality and contestation within a transparent and interpretable framework. The contribution of this work is thus twofold: it provides a conceptual foundation for evolving ontologies in digital heritage and a lightweight demonstration of how such models can be instantiated and explored computationally.},
